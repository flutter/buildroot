Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe*) from the
tarball's src folder over to src, then checking for removed or added files
and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly.
